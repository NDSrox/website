    <p id="main-explainer">In my kitchen, some of the cabinet doors have windows in them. Each of these panes of glass are held in by several rubber pieces that are screwed into the door and press up against the edge of the glass. One of these cabinet doors had a very wobbly window. Upon further inspection, I found that it was being held in by only one of these bits. I decided to remove the pane and the last part holding it in, and took the component with me to school. In my free time, I designed a CAD model for it on TinkerCAD, using my caliper for very percise measurments. When I got home, I used my 3D printer to, essentially, make white clones of the original piece. I installed them and they hold it great!</p>

    <div id="phone-holder">
        <p>I noticed that my grandmother had an issue with her phone in the car. There wasnâ€™t a phone holder that would work for her, making the use of GPS very difficult. After finding out about this, I found a cup that almost perfectly fit the cup holder and measured it up with my digital caliper. In TinkerCAD, I made a replica of the cup and an angled holder for the phone that hugs the corners of the phone but leaves an open slot for the charging cable. However, the back broke when someone dropped a bag on it, and it snapped along the layer lines. I remembered an STL file I saw that was a phone holder, which also directed the audio from said phone towards the user. I made another design that incorporated this, printed it for my grandmother.
